- Android 7.0(API 24)
- Android 7.1(API 25)
- Android 8.0(API 26)

## Build

Import and build the project in Android Studio(__with Instant Run disabled__). There are four modules:

- `app`. This is the VirtualApp application module.
- `lib`. This is the VirtualApp library module.
- `YAHFA`. This is the YAHFA hook module.
- `demoHookPlugin`. This is a demo hook plugin which compiles to an APK.

## Usage

- Write and build a hook plugin APK. You can take a look at the [demoHookPlugin](/VirtualApp/demoHookPlugin) module for reference. __Don't forget to put following meta-data in AndroidManifest.xml:__

```xml
    <application
        android:label="@string/app_name">
        <meta-data
            android:name="yahfa.hook.plugin"
            android:value="true"
        />
    </application>
```

- Push the plugin APK to sdcard
- Run VirtualHook and click the `Add` button
- Swipe to the 'APPS IN SDCARD' page. Then select and add hook plugins which are displayed with an icon ![](/VirtualApp/app/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/ic_extension_black_24dp.png)
- Add and run non-plugin apps
